: How to create indexes for the RUM pipeline :
 --------------------------------------------

These instructions have three parts:

1) Your organism is available on the ucsc genome browser
2) Your organism is available on the ensembl website
3) Your organism is not on either ucsc or ensembl but you have genome sequence
   and optionally gene or transcript models.

Prerequisites: You need bowtie installed on your system, including bowtie-build
which should come with the default installation.  The bowtie-build executable
must be in the system path.  If that's not possible then you can edit the perl
scripts where bowtie-build is called to add the full path.  

NOTE: Some genome builds contain haplotype copies of the same chromosome.
You should not include multiple haplotypes in a RUM index because the pipeline
will consider reads mapping to two haplotypes as non-uniquely determined
alignments.  Therefore when we built the human indexes we left out the
chromosomes with 'hap' in the name, you should probably do the same when
building your own indexes.  

1) Your organism is available on the ucsc genome browser
--------------------------------------------------------

This first part explains how to get the genome sequence using the table
browser.  You can alternatively get it from the downloads page as follows:

  The downloads link is on the left of the home page, find the species and
  hit the "Full data set" and get the file with the genome sequence, unmasked,
  sometimes it's called chromFA.tar.gz, or something like that.  When you unpack it,
  it may be in many pieces, possibly distributed into subdirectories.  You
  must concatenate them all together into one file and name that file
  NAME_genome.txt (where "NAME" is defined below).  The file name MUST end in 'txt'
  not 'fa'.  After that proceed with the instructions to get the gene models file(s)
  using the table browser.

If you do not opt to get the fasta files from the download page, then use
the following instructions:

Go to UCSC's main page (http://genome.ucsc.edu/), choose the organism and
assembly.

Go to Table Browser and set the options as follows:

group: all tables
table: chromInfo
output format: selected fields from primary and related tables
output file: chromosome_sizes.txt
hit "get output" and choose the 'chrom' and 'size' fields.

Now remove the header line (if any) from chromosome_sizes.txt and add columns so rows look like this:

chr1    0       249250621       +
chr2    0       181748087	+
....

in other words, add a column with '0' between the chr and size cols, and add a col with '+' at the end

* The next steps get fasta file with the complete genome sequence.

Submit the file from the previous step to the genome browser as a custom track, then go to table browser
and set as follows:

group: custom tracks
track: User Track
region: genome
output format: sequence
output file: NAME_genome.txt
file type returned: gzip

where "NAME" should be replaced by something that identifies your name/assembly, eg mm9.
Just use alphanumeric, dashes, periods in NAME, do not use underscores.
The scripts below won't work unless you follow this naming convention exactly.
Note the suffix must be '.txt' not '.fa'

Hit get output, and request all upper case

gunzip the file and run:

Now to make files of gene info and sequence:
 - you can use any of the annotation tracks as long as they have the five fields you
are asked to select below:
 - the following illustrates using two tracks "UCSC Known" and "RefSeq".  
 - If there are many annotation tracks, such as for mouse where there are more than ten,
   you probably shouldn't include them all, by default we have been using just three of
   them for mouse: refseq, ucsc and aceview.  Using all tracks would create a transcript
   db that is too complex, it's better to let blat map the reads for transcripts that
   are not present in the db rather than to expand the db too much with false transcripts.

Set the table browser as follows:

group: Genes and Gene Prediction Tracks
track: UCSC Genes (or whatever track you like)
table: knownGene (or whatever is the corresponding name for the track you chose)
region: genome
output format: selected fields from primary and related tables
output file: ucscknown.txt (keep the name of this file simple, but it must end in '.txt')

Hit "get output"

Select the following fields from the table:
name
chrom
strand
exonStarts
exonEnds

hit "get output".

Now do the same thing but get RefSeq genes, save to file called: refseq.txt
  - Set 'table' to be "refGene".

make a file called "gene_info_files" with one line per gene annotation filename:
--------------
refseq.txt
ucscknown.txt

All the scripts and the data files you just downloaded need to be in the same
directory.  Now run:

> perl create_indexes_from_ucsc.pl NAME_genome.txt NAME_refseq_ucsc
  - this is a master script that runs a bunch of other scripts including bowtie-build...
  - you will need a fair amount of RAM to do this, 10Gb was sufficient for Human

After it is finished, the files you need to keep are the following 15:

NAME_refseq_ucsc_gene_info.txt
NAME_genome_one-line-seqs.fa
NAME_genes.4.ebwt
NAME_genes.3.ebwt
NAME_genes.2.ebwt
NAME_genes.1.ebwt
NAME_genes.rev.2.ebwt
NAME_genes.rev.1.ebwt
NAME_genome.4.ebwt
NAME_genome.3.ebwt
NAME_genome.2.ebwt
NAME_genome.1.ebwt
NAME_genome.rev.2.ebwt
NAME_genome.rev.1.ebwt
rum.config_NAME

Put all but rum.config_NAME in the indexes directory.  The last file rum.config_NAME
might need to be edited if you have put anything somewhere other than the default
locations.  The default location to put rum.config_NAME is in RUM's lib directory
(but it actually doesn't matter where you put it, you specify its location when you
run RUM).

 *** Note: edit rum.config_NAME if you have moved any scripts, executables, or indexes
     from their default locations.

-- THIS ENDS THE UCSC INSTRUCTIONS --

2) Your organism is available on the ensembl website
----------------------------------------------------

Go to ensembl.org and find your species.  Note that the default site is for
vertibrates, there are currently five sites for different kingdoms:

http://www.ensembl.org/
http://metazoa.ensembl.org/
http://fungi.ensembl.org/
http://plants.ensembl.org/
http://bacteria.ensembl.org/

Once you found your species, click on the "Downloads" link at the top of the page (you 
may have to stretch your browser wide enough to see it).  On the Downloads page scroll
down to the section called "FTP site" and click the "FTP site" link.  You should see a
table full of links on the right.  

Click the "FASTA (DNA)" link for your species, it should open in a new window.
You want the file that has "toplevel" in the name and *not* 'rm' (which stands
for 'repeat masked').  So for example for the fungus aspergillus nidulans we
would get this file:

> Aspergillus_nidulans.CADRE2.dna.toplevel.fa.gz

gunzip the file and it should be a fasta file of the complete genome.

Rename the file to be: NAME_genome.txt
where "NAME" should be replaced by something that identifies your name/assembly,
e.g. mouse-mm9.  Just use alphanumeric, dashes, periods in NAME, do not use
underscores.  The scripts below won't work unless you follow this naming convention
exactly.  Note the suffix must be '.txt' not '.fa'

Now go back to the big table of links on the FTP page and click the "GTF" link for
your species.

Download and gunzip the gtf file.

Now make sure all the scripts and the two data files you just downloaded are in the same
directory.  Run the following:

> perl create_indexes_from_ensembl.pl NAME_genome.txt <gtf>

Where <gtf> is the name of the gtf file you downloaded, and NAME is the name you
have chosen above.

  - this is a master script that runs a bunch of other scripts including bowtie-build...
  - you will need a fair amount of RAM to do this, 10Gb was sufficient for Human

After it is finished, the files you need to keep are the following 15:

NAME_refseq_ucsc_gene_info.txt
NAME_genome_one-line-seqs.fa
NAME_genes.4.ebwt
NAME_genes.3.ebwt
NAME_genes.2.ebwt
NAME_genes.1.ebwt
NAME_genes.rev.2.ebwt
NAME_genes.rev.1.ebwt
NAME_genome.4.ebwt
NAME_genome.3.ebwt
NAME_genome.2.ebwt
NAME_genome.1.ebwt
NAME_genome.rev.2.ebwt
NAME_genome.rev.1.ebwt
rum.config_NAME

Put all but rum.config_NAME in the indexes directory.  The last file rum.config_NAME
might need to be edited if you have put anything somewhere other than the default
locations.  The default location to put rum.config_NAME is in RUM's lib directory
(but it actually doesn't matter where you put it, you specify its location when you
run RUM).

 *** Note: edit rum.config_NAME if you have moved any scripts, executables, or indexes
     from their default locations.

-- THIS ENDS THE ENSEMBL INSTRUCTIONS --

3) Your organism is not on either ucsc or ensembl but you have genome sequence
   and optionally gene or transcript models.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If your organism is not available through UCSC, you must create by hand the files
described below, and then run some (supplied) parsing scripts. Be careful to follow
the specifications exactly.

   1. A fasta file of genome sequence with one entry per chromosome/contig/scaffold.
The fasta def lines should give simple chromosome/contig/scaffold names. Stick to
alphanumeric characters, underscores, periods, dashes. You might get away with other
characters but definitely do not use colons, quotes or whitespace. Use the forward
(plus) strand sequence, all bases should be upper case A, C, G, T or N. The first
base of each entry will be considered be cooordinate number 1 of the
chromosome/contig/scaffold.  Call this file NAME_genome.txt, where "NAME" should be
replaced by something that identifies your name/assembly, e.g. mouse-mm9.  Just use
alphanumeric, dashes, periods in NAME, do not use underscores.  The scripts below
won't work unless you follow this naming convention exactly.  Note the suffix must
be '.txt' not '.fa'

  2. A file (or files) of transcript models. Keep the name(s) of these files simple,
like refseq.txt. A transcript model file has one row for each transcript, with each
row havin five tab delimited colums:
         1. name: The name of the transcript. Keep it relatively simple, use just
            alphanumeric, underscores, dashes and periods. Names don't have to be
            unique, the parsing scripts will make them unique later by adding numbers
            to ones that are equal.
         2. chrom: The name of the chromosome/contig/scaffold the transcript is on
            Names should match those in the genome fasta file.
         3. strand: The strand, + or -.
         4. exonStarts: A comma delimited list (with no whitespace) of exon start
            locations in zero based coordinates. The last character can be a comma,
            but not the first.
         5. exonEnds: A comma delimited list (with no whitespace) of exon end locations
            in one based coordinates. The last character can be a comma, but not the
            first. 

   Note 1: It is not a typo that we want zero-based coordinates for the starts and
           one-based coordinates for the ends, we are just being compliant with UCSC
           standards.
   Note 2: You can make multiple files of transcripts, the parsing scripts will take
           care of merging them into one consistent database of transcripts. If two
           files have the same transcript, even if they have different names, the
           scripts will merge them into one and merge the names. Basically, in your
           gene models files, different transcripts can have the same name and one
           transcript can have serveral different names, even in the same file. All
           you need to worry about is getting each file formatted exactly as described
           above. 

Make a file called "gene_info_files" with one line per gene annotation filename
(even if you have only one).  E.g.:

refseq.txt
ucscknown.txt

All the scripts and the data files you just downloaded need to be in the same
directory.  Now run:

> perl create_indexes_from_ucsc.pl NAME_genome.txt NAME_refseq_ucsc
  - NAME is as defined above - make sure there are no underscores in NAME
  - this is a master script that runs a bunch of other scripts including bowtie-build...
  - you will need a fair amount of RAM to do this, 10Gb was sufficient for Human

After it is finished, the files you need to keep are the following 15:

NAME_refseq_ucsc_gene_info.txt
NAME_genome_one-line-seqs.fa
NAME_genes.4.ebwt
NAME_genes.3.ebwt
NAME_genes.2.ebwt
NAME_genes.1.ebwt
NAME_genes.rev.2.ebwt
NAME_genes.rev.1.ebwt
NAME_genome.4.ebwt
NAME_genome.3.ebwt
NAME_genome.2.ebwt
NAME_genome.1.ebwt
NAME_genome.rev.2.ebwt
NAME_genome.rev.1.ebwt
rum.config_NAME

Put all but rum.config_NAME in the indexes directory.  The last file rum.config_NAME
might need to be edited if you have put anything somewhere other than the default
locations.  The default location to put rum.config_NAME is in RUM's lib directory
(but it actually doesn't matter where you put it, you specify its location when you
run RUM).

 *** Note: edit rum.config_NAME if you have moved any scripts, executables, or indexes
     from their default locations.
